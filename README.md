To Do List

Let's create a simple to do application 

    ✓ Show an unordered list of to do's. 
    ✓ Show an input to enter a new to do. 
    ✓ Show a button to add a to do. 
    
    When the button is clicked: 

    (Work in progress) The text from the input box is used to add a list item to the bottom of the list. 
    (Work in progress) The text from the input box is cleared out. 

    ✓ When the user clicks on a list item, it is removed.

Extra Credit: - When a list item is clicked, cross it out, then remove it after 1 second.
